# Abstract
Predator-prey dynamics are crucial for the survival of an ecosystem. The likelihood of a prey being caught by a predator depends not only on their relative speeds but also on the characteristics of their local environment. For example, in the macroscopic world, the wolf must be able to move through a dense forest in order to catch the deer. In this study, we introduce an idealised one-dimensional model in which a prey and a predator must overcome a potential barrier to engage in a chase. The model is based on the overdamped Newtonian equation, and it is solved for two possible cases: on a parabolic potential barrier and on a periodic potential barrier. 

To determine the likelihood of a predator catching the prey, it is necessary to understand the timing and location of catching events. Therefore, we introduce methods on finding the catching time and position. It is not possible to solve this analytically, therefore we need numerical solutions through simulations.

Within the parabolic potential barrier, catching and escape can occur. In the periodic potential barrier, however, escape is undefined. Therefore, we study the behaviour of the predator and prey in a periodic potential barrier as they chase each other in a circular trajectory. We investigate the number of revolutions required for the predator to catch the prey and discuss our findings.
